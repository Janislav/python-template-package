Motivation
==========

Creating python modules and packages are daily tasks in the live of a python developer,
but actually, it's basically everytime the same process.

So i'am thought it would be a good idea to give an example and a template
which can be used to setup a python module without to have a bigger dive
into the matter.


Things you should notice
========================

The way this package is build **IS NOT** the default way of doing
(if their is a way), but it has some advantages in my eyes which i will
maybe discuse in the coming docs, or not, we will see. Moreover i want to
say that i'am **NOT** the "expert" in this topic, but i've a working way
and want to share it ;)
